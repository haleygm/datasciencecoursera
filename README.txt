Experiment Information: (Given)

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'Data_Dictionary.txt': List of all variables and unit of observation (codebook)

- 'run_analysis.R': Script to create full and averaged tidy data set

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Range from 1-30 (observation identifiers)

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Range from 1-30 (observation identifiers)

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'features.txt': Provides the variable name for each column in X_test.txt and X_train.txt 

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set (variable measurements)

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels (activity)

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set (variable measurements)

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels (activity)

- "Averaged_Data.csv": Final tidy data set of average for each subject-activity combination's variables


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
